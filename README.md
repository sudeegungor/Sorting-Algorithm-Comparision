# Sorting-Algorithm-Comparision
Sorting is one of the basic operations in computer science. There are different sorting algorithms that have been designed and this report will be analyzing performance comparisons among the two sorting algorithms: Merge sort and Quick sort. The running times will be compared relating to space complexity. Both algorithms are useful in their own way but the question is which is to be used and when. Each algorithm sorts given array with a unique function. In this research Merge sort is analyzed for two different partitions: Two parts and Three parts. And Quick sort is analyzed for three different pivots: First, Random and Middle among First, Mid, Last elements.
